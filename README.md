The code is a Python implementation of Peter Norvig's algorithm and Wolf Garbe's SymSpell algorithm to perform single-word spelling correction. The report discusses extensively the problem, presenting a theoretical model (Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance, noisy channel model, etc.) and the two algorithms, together with an analysis of their complexity and performance.
